# AMKNN
Neural Networks Implementation in pure C++
The goal was, as usual, to do everything from scratch without using any external libraries.
# Demo
I also made a demo program (included in the code in files **program.cpp** & **program.h**) where I implemented **implicit neural representations** on images,
and also used the **Sine** function as a **non-linearity** (aka. Activation).

you can [download](https://github.com/AliMustafa731/AMKNN/releases/download/Release/AMKNN.zip) it.
